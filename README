Parallel-Supervisor version 0.01
================================

Many modules provide functionality somewhat similar to
Parallel::Supervisor, but none are quite like this. The goal is to 
provide a mechanism for managing a collection of jobs and monitoring
their output, while remaining as un-complicated and as flexible as
possible. 

This module can be integrated with Parallel::Jobs,
Parallel::ForkManager, and probably other modules which provide some
mechanism of forking, or by calling fork() itself.

The Parallel::Supervisor object tracks the state of each job (prepared,
running, or finished) and creates a pipe to connect the output of the
worker to the parent for reading. For situations where this
functionality is all that is required, it is much easier to implement
than more complicated solutions such as the top-level Supervisor
modules, or sophisticated frameworks such as POE. Worker processes do
not need to be specifically designed for use in its context, and the
module makes no assumptions about the logic or control flow, allowing
the parent to respond to the output, or exit status of a job as
required. 

Please see the perldoc for more details.
